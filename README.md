# subset-sum-problem-variation
It is a variation for the the subset sum problem approach with dynamic solution, i think...

The way to use it is:

1)Compile the file using gcc -o <name you want to give to the executable file> <name of the file>
2)It takes as parameters the number of elements of the array and the sum we want to achieve with the subsets
    <Name of executable file> <Number of elements> <Sum>

The array is filled with 1,2,3.... There are some comments on the generateArray function to allow numbers be generated randomly
